# 🔐 Password Cracker

A dynamic web application that simulates password cracking using various hashing techniques and evaluates password strength with a visually interactive UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Simulates cracking of hashed passwords (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.)
- 💪 Real-time password strength checker
- 🧠 Educational: learn how hashing algorithms affect security
- 🖥️ Dynamic and responsive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User enters a password.
2. The app hashes the password using different algorithms.
3. The system attempts to crack the hash by comparing it to a dictionary or brute force simulation.
4. Shows:
   - Hash output
   - Cracking progress or result
   - Password strength with visual indicators
